# module-4-pandas-challenge-
The purpose of this research is to examine standardized test scores across a city's school system. As the district's Chief Data Scientist, I will be using the Python package Pandas to analyze and conduct research on a large dataset containing student test results in mathematics and reading. It is hoped that by compiling this information, the school board and mayor will be better able to set priorities and allocate resources. Student performance across schools, school performance by budget, size, and type, and student performance at different grade levels are some of the angles that will be explored in this dataset. We will also investigate the top and bottom schools in terms of overall passing percentage. A report will summarize the analysis and highlight the most important takeaways. This report will be available as a Jupyter notebook under the 'pandas-challenge' repository on GitHub.
